Overview
--------

This is a collection of classes that have been found to be useful
in unified communications / VoIP projects

Some of the classes are a fresh implementation from OpenTelecoms.org,
and others have been obtained from other open source projects and
possibly adapted in some way.

This code is used to support a range of projects:

  http://www.lumicall.org             Lumicall SIP dialer for Android

  http://www.opentelecoms.org/zrtp    OpenTelecoms.org ZRTP stack for Java

Please see the OpenTelecoms.org web site for more details about
secure Federated VoIP (including SIP and Jabber/XMPP):

Crypto classes
--------------

Export notice: no actual cryptographic code is included, so export
restrictions do not apply.
